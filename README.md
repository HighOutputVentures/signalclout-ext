## About <a name = "about"></a>

[Signalclout](https://www.signalclout.com) has this very useful feature in their website - [Profile Analyzer](https://www.signalclout.com/profile-analyzer), in which you can view the [Bitclout](https://bitclout.com/) creator's profile and details by supplying the username. This tool was developed to address the pain among many users on the repetitive action of copying and pasting the username of a creator from the Bitclout website to the Signalclout profile search bar.
